# Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to workflows-mcp.

This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") is based on the [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf), adapted for this project.

## Open Source Commitment

**workflows-mcp will always remain open source under AGPL-3.0.**

This CLA enables us to offer commercial licenses to organizations that cannot use AGPL software (due to copyleft requirements), while keeping the open source version freely available. This is the same model used by [Grafana](https://grafana.com/licensing/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), and many other successful open source projects.

Your contributions will **always** be available under AGPL-3.0, regardless of any commercial licensing.

### 1. Definitions

- **"You"** means the individual or legal entity making this Agreement.

- **"Submit"** means any form of communication sent to the project (pull request, issue, patch, etc.).

### 2. Grant of Copyright License

You grant to the project maintainer and recipients of software distributed by the project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to:

- Reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute your Contributions and derivative works
- Sublicense these rights to third parties

### 3. Grant of Patent License

You grant to the project maintainer and recipients a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, use, sell, and distribute your Contributions, where such license applies only to patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution alone.

### 4. Representations

You represent that:

- You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses
- Each Contribution is your original creation
- If you have an employer, you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, or your employer has waived such rights

### 5. No Warranty

## Why We Need This CLA

This CLA allows us to:

1. **Offer commercial licenses** to enterprises that cannot use AGPL (e.g., companies with blanket AGPL bans)
2. **Defend the project legally** if disputes arise
3. **Keep the project sustainable** through dual-licensing revenue

It does **NOT** allow us to:

- Close-source the project (AGPL version remains forever)
- Remove your contributions from the open source version
- Claim sole authorship of your work
