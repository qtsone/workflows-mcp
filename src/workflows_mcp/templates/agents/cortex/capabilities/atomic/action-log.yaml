  Atomic capability: Log action for deduplication before execution.
  Used by ACT phase to prevent duplicate mutations.

  Deduplication uses SHA256 hash of (capability, inputs) to identify
  duplicate requests. If an identical action exists, returns cached result.

  Action statuses:
  - pending: Logged but not yet executed
  - completed: Successfully executed
  - failed: Execution failed
  - rolled_back: Action was reversed
