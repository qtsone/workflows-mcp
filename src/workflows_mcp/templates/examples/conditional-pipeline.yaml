# Conditional CI Pipeline Workflow
#
# Demonstrates Phase 2.0 features:
# - Variable resolution: ${block_id.field} syntax
# - Conditional execution: Skip blocks based on boolean expressions
# - Branching: Different paths based on test results
# - Convergence: Notification block runs regardless of path taken
#
# This workflow simulates a CI/CD pipeline where:
# 1. Tests run first
# 2. If tests pass (exit_code == 0), deployment proceeds
# 3. If tests fail (exit_code != 0), failure notification is sent
# 4. Final notification always runs
