"""
Execution context for dependency injection and fractal composition.

Provides access to:
- Workflow registry (for Workflow composition)
- Executor registry (for block execution)
- Checkpoint store (for pause/resume)
- Parent execution (for nested workflows)

This enables:
- Fractal composition (workflows in workflows)
- Access to shared resources (registries)
- Execution isolation (each workflow gets its own context)
